# MoyaiJS

MoyaiJS is a Discord Bot made in JavaScript. The bot interacts with the Discord API by interacting through Node.js. MoyaiJS does not have the amount of commands like MoyaiPY. However, I plan to create more commands for this bot. I am going to try to recreate every command from MoyaiPY and implement them in MoyaiJS. The following below contains the commands and their category classifications:

1. Info Commands
   - whois: shows information about an user
   - av: enlarges the pinged user's profile picture

2. Mod Commands
   - purge: allows users with manage messages to mass delete previous messages within a channel

3. Fun Commands 
   - catfact: Invoke the command and the bot will output a random catfact
